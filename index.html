    <h3>Concepts & Story</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p id='body-copy'>My initial idea was to have a ‘search’ function that would be based on an ‘ACTION’, which is how all of the art in the world is created.  Richard Serra’s famous ‘VERB LIST’ in which he compiled as a guide to his process and development of his sculptures, but more - to all artwork.  When searching for a visual depiction of this, I found a work of his called “The Matter of Time”, which consists of 7 monumental sculptures, on permanent view at the Guggenheim Bilbao.  Viewing his sketches for this work, I realized that 7 verbscould distinctly describe this work, and that led to how I could create a search on how verbs might search artwork at the MET..</p>
